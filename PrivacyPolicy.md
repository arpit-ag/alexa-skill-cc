**Privacy Policy**

Customer Care operates as an Amazon Alexa Skill created by Arpit Agarwal under BootStrap LLC. It is our responsibility to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating.

We may use your Personal Information only to provide a personalized user experience. By enabling the skill, you agree to use of information in accordance with this policy.

**Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information**

At present the skill doesn't collect any personally identifying user information. But in future certain users to Customer Care’s skill may choose to interact in ways that require this skill to gather personally-identifying information in future. The amount and type of information that the skill may gather depends on the nature of the interaction. We do not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And users can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information by not disabling the skill.

**Information We Collect from Other Sources**

With your authorization, we might also obtain information about you from other sources in future. When you link your account to any third party services, we will receive information from that service (such as your birthday) via an API call to that service.

**Data Retention Policy**

We will not retain any user provided data.

**Log Data**

To be able to investigate issues with the skill, we stores logs with Amazon CloudWatch. These logs may included personally-identifying information as well, which are not exposed, sold or used besides the tracking of issues.

**Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information**

BootStrap discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on BootStrap’s behalf, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees may be located outside of your home country; by using BootStrap’s skill, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. BootStrap will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, as described above, BootStrap discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when BootStrap believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of BootStrap, third parties or the public at large. BootStrap takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.

**Privacy Policy Changes**

Although most changes are likely to be minor, BootStrap may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in BootStrap’s sole discretion. BootStrap encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. Your continued use of this skill after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.
